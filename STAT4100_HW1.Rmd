#Chapter 1 Homework (Experiment Design):

### Optimized microwave settings and popcorn brand

#### Response Variable will be the count of unpopped kernels without burning

#### The factos will be as follows:
Power Setting  | Time Setting (minutes) | Popcorn Brand
  -------------| -------------          | -------------
Low            |  2:00                  | Costco
High           |  2:30                  | Pop Secret

Here's a table with a random run order:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
Power <- c("Low", "High")
Time <- c(2, 2.5)
Brand <- c("Costco", "PopSecret")
b <- as.data.frame(table(Power, Time, Brand))
b <- b[,1:3]
b$r <- runif(8)
b <- b[order(b$r), ]
b[,1:3]
```

#Chapter 2 Homework:
## No.1
Note:  Group A will be treated with 95 C.  Group B will be treated with 100 C
```{r}
A <- c(11.176, 7.089, 8.097, 11.739, 11.291, 10.759, 6.467, 8.315)
B <- c(5.263, 6.748, 7.461, 7.015, 8.133, 7.418, 3.772, 8.963)
D <- as.data.frame(cbind(A, B))
t <- t.test(B, A, var.equal = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)
t
```

a) There is evidence to suggest there is a meaningful difference between the two baking temperatures.  At alpha = 0.05 level we would reject the null hypothesis. 

b) The p-value for the test is `r t$p.value`.  This is well below 0.05.

c) The confidence interval for this test is [`r t$conf.int`].  Zero is not contained within this interval.  This means it is a statistically significant result.  

d) QQ plots below:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# qq plot for var A
qqnorm(A)
qqline(A)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# qq plot for var B
qqnorm(B)
qqline(B)
```

```{r}
# Shapiro test for normaility
shapiro.test(A)
shapiro.test(B)
```

```{r}
boxplot(D, col = "green", ylab = "kA")
```


## No.2
```{r}
y1 <- 93
y2 <- 102
s1 <- 12.9
s2 <- 6.1
n1 <- 10
n2 <- 12
# Note: variances cannot be assumed to be equal:
# adjussted degrees of freedom:
v <- (((s1^2/n1) + (s2^2/n2))^2) / ((((s1^2/n1)^2)/(n1-1)) + ((s2^2/n2)^2/(n2-1)))
# t test statistic:
t0 <- (y1 - y2) / sqrt((s1^2/n1) + (s2^2/n2))
t0 # t statistic
pt(t0, df = v) #compute p-value.
```
The test statistic for this test is t = `r t0`.  The critical value, with d.f = `r v`, is = `r qt(0.1, df = v)`.  We would reject the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.1.  There is evidence to suggest that there are less particulates in a non-smokers home than in a smokers home.
